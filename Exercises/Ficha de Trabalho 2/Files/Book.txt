Programs that will run as console applications
under Visual Studio C++ are programs that
read data from the command line and output
the results to the command line. To avoid
having to dig into the complexities of creating
and managing application windows before you
have enough knowledge to understand how
they work, all the examples that you will write
to understand how the C++ language works
will be console programs, either Win32
console programs or .NET console programs.
This will enable you to focus entirely on the
C++ language in the first instance; once you
have mastered that, you will be ready to deal
with creating and managing application
windows. You will first look at how console
programs are structured.
