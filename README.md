# Programming (PROG) - Year 1, Semester 2 (Y1S2)

This repository contains all the exercises and assessments of the UC Programming, taught by [Jorge Silva](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/FUNC_GERAL.FORMVIEW?p_codigo=208785) at [Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742) [MIEIC] at the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.Inicial) [FEUP]. <br/>

## Here are several documents, namely:

### My Drafts <br/>
Pieces of code for exercises and assessments, notes that I take during practical classes and other experiences using C and C++ languages. It is an authentic disorganized notebook. <br/>

### Notes
Notes that I take during theoretical lectures.<br/>

### Exercises
Varied exercises of easy, medium and difficult level, about the subject taught in the present week. They complement the weekly work developed during the practical classes. <br/>

### Tic Tac Toe ++
Personal project that includes much of the knowledge acquired in the practical and theorical lectures.

### Project 1
Pratical work done between 29/03/2021 and 30/04/2021 with [Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/Pedro-PFerreira). <br>
Developed in C++ language, this project is a Robot's Game with a maze that will be loaded from .txt simple file. using several datatypes (strings, arrays, vectors, structs, files and dinamically memory allocation, Operating System compatibility) and modules that are available in StandardLibrary. <br>
After the deadline, the project can be viewed in [Proj 1 PROG](https://github.com/Fabio-A-Sa/Proj_PROG). <br/>
Grade: 17.2/20 <br/>

### Project 2
Pratical work done between 08/05/2021 and 28/05/2021 with [Pedro Ferreira](https://github.com/Pedro-PFerreira). <br>
Developed in C++ language, this project is a Robot's Game with a maze that will be loaded from .txt simple file. using several datatypes (strings, arrays, vectors, structs, files and dinamically memory allocation, Operating System compatibility) and modules that are available in StandardLibrary. This is an Object Oriented Version of the last project. <br>
After the deadline, the project can be viewed in [Proj 2 PROG](https://github.com/Pedro-PFerreira/PROJ_PROG_2). <br/>
Grade: 16.0/20 <br/>
